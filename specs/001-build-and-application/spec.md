# Feature Specification: Project Estimation Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-and-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build and application that can help me get a rough estimate on how long it would take to complete a software project like a Web application or mobile app. A user should be able to add in predfined tasks and set a count. Example Large complex web screen 3. In a configuration section of rough estimate application, A user should be able to adjust the defualt min and max hours it could take to complete. Using the count data and min max  A user should be able to see the total hour estimate for the proposed project."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A project manager or developer wants to quickly estimate the time required for a software project. They select predefined task types (like "Large complex web screen"), specify quantities for each task type, and receive an estimated time range based on configurable minimum and maximum hours per task type. They can adjust the default time estimates in a configuration section to match their team's velocity or project complexity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the estimation application, **When** they select a task type "Large complex web screen" and set count to 3, **Then** the system displays a time estimate based on the configured min/max hours for that task type
2. **Given** a user has added multiple task types with quantities, **When** they view the project summary, **Then** the system shows the total estimated hours range (minimum to maximum) for the entire project
3. **Given** a user accesses the configuration section, **When** they modify the default min/max hours for a task type, **Then** the system updates all current and future estimates using the new values
4. **Given** a user has created a project estimate, **When** they save the project, **Then** they can later retrieve and modify the estimate

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user sets count to 0 for a task type?
- How does the system handle very large quantities that might result in unrealistic estimates?
- What happens if min hours is set higher than max hours in configuration?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to select from predefined task types (e.g., "Large complex web screen", "Simple web screen", "API endpoint", "Database design")
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to specify a count/quantity for each selected task type
- **FR-003**: System MUST calculate and display time estimates based on task count multiplied by configured min/max hours per task type
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a configuration section where users can adjust default min and max hours for each task type
- **FR-005**: System MUST display total project time estimate as a range (minimum to maximum hours)
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist user configurations and project estimates [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: local storage, database, or file-based persistence?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what task types should be predefined? Should users be able to add custom task types?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: multiple projects simultaneously or one project at a time?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: export functionality for estimates (PDF, CSV, etc.) or just display?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Task Type**: Represents a category of work (name, default min hours, default max hours, description)
- **Project Estimate**: Contains selected task types with quantities and calculated time estimates
- **Configuration**: User-defined settings for task type time estimates
